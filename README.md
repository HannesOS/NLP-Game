In this game, the player must guess a specific word randomly selected from a subset of the English vocabulary.
After each guess, the player receives feedback (both visually and through text) on the semantic similarity between their guess and the target word, aiding them in subsequent guesses.
To determine semantic proximity, the game's backend constructs an embedding space of the vocabulary and computes cosine similarities between words 
Additionally, players have the option to receive hints consisting of words that are semantically similar to the target word.
